# Dad-Project

#This Project is a system about student who need to enroll subjects for every semester.

#User - Student 
#Student can choose to enroll what kind of subject that they want using while using Java and PHP. The middleware that we #are using is RESTFULAPI so that the PHP code can communicate with the database. 

#User - Admin
#Admin can add and update a subject for the user to enroll. Admin also can view what type of subject that they will offer #to the student. To develop admin page, we are using java file and the middleware is SOCKET. There are a JAVA file that #act as a server that will communicate with the database using a certain port.
